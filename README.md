Machine Learning for Business (MIS 451) - Course & Project Overview

I am currently taking Machine Learning for Business (MIS 451), a practice-oriented course that focuses on applying machine learning techniques to solve real business problems. The course combines theory with hands-on implementation, giving me the opportunity to work with real datasets, build models in Python, and translate analytical results into meaningful business insights.

Throughout the semester, I explore a range of topics such as data preprocessing, supervised and unsupervised learning, classification, forecasting, natural language processing, deep learning, and generative AI. Each topic involves practical coding exercises, in-class activities, and project components where I apply algorithms to business-oriented scenarios.

My coursework includes building predictive models, performing clustering and sentiment analysis, experimenting with neural networks, evaluating model performance, and presenting findings in a business context. Using tools such as Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and Python-based analytics environments, I learn how to turn data into decision-support insights.

Beyond technical skills, the course emphasizes ethical AI, problem formulation, and communicating machine learning results to non-technical audiences. Through these projects, I aim to strengthen my ability to design end-to-end data solutions - from cleaning raw data to model deployment - and understand how machine learning creates strategic value in organizations.

This repository showcases my code, exercises, experiments, and project deliverables from the course as I continue learning and improving my machine learning competency.
